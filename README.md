🧠 Comprehensive Experiment Description

This experiment demonstrates real-time fusion between speech and text modalities using a multimodal deep learning pipeline. It shows how AI systems can instantly transcribe human speech into text and evaluate its emotional tone using a sentiment classifier. The process runs seamlessly within a single workflow, providing an example of synchronized multimodal understanding.

✏️ Objective

The main goal is to implement a simple yet powerful demonstration of live multimodal interaction, where the model listens, interprets, and reacts in one continuous computational stream. This approach reflects how real-time AI agents such as virtual assistants and conversational robots achieve contextual comprehension.

📘 Results

The system successfully transcribes an English audio clip — “I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed” — and classifies the sentiment as positive with a confidence score of 0.9996.
This outcome validates the capability of deep models to perform simultaneous speech recognition and emotional reasoning within milliseconds, confirming that fusion-based reasoning enhances responsiveness and contextual accuracy.

📗 Notes

The experiment uses Hugging Face’s Whisper-small for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and DistilBERT for sentiment analysis, ensuring computational efficiency with minimal latency.

No manual uploads or downloads are required all processing occurs directly in the cloud environment.

The architecture can be expanded to include additional streams such as gesture, gaze, or environmental sensors to achieve true real-time multimodal AI interaction.
